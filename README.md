# Which method to use
## Using a Virtual Machine
> TODO!

## Using an external source
**Ethernet** is the preferred method and is recommended for most users.

If not available, you can use **WiFi**. With some external USB WiFi cards, it just doesn't work. This is why it's only an *if*. 

# Instructions

## Windows


## Linux


# Scripts
On **Windows**, you can use a script to create a bridge instead of doing everything again manually.

The file is located at the [scripts](scripts) folder.

If you need to change IPs, just change the variables in the script.
